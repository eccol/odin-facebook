This is the final Rails project from The Odin Project:  
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project

The focus is on Rails, not CSS. This will be ugly, but as long as it's functional I'll be satisfied.  
I think I will use Bootstrap, might as well learn that too.

The goal is to build a Facebook clone with the following features:

* ~~Users can send friend requests~~ DONE
* ~~Users must accept friend requests to become friends~~ DONE
* Friend requests appear in a notification section (Works but is ugly, will improve)
* ~~Users can create posts~~ DONE
* Users can like posts (Works but does not display yet)
* Users can comment on posts (Works but is ugly, will improve)
* ~~The homepage displays recent posts from the current user and their friends~~ DONE
* Users can edit their profile information (Works but needs DRYing up)
* The user's profile page displays profile information and posts (Works for general user pages, not the profile page)
* A user index page lists users so friend requests can be sent (Works but is ugly, will improve)

After those, I will work on implementing these features:

* Posts can be text or images
* Users can upload profile pictures (The button is there but needs a lot more work)
* Users can sign in with a real Facebook account
* ~~Welcome emails and friend request notification emails~~ DONE the bare minimum
